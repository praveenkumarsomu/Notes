# Notes
Used MVVM architecture. As possible as tried to use Protocol oriented programming. 
## Dependencies 
Used Swift package manager (https://swift.org/package-manager/) to integrate third party frameworks 
* Swinject - Dependency injection framework [GitHub] (https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject)
* FireBase - FireStore database [GitHub] (https://github.com/firebase/)
Note:- Commited all the pod files to run the project easily for evalutation normally I will add Pods folder in git ignore file

## Unit testing:
Written unit tests only I have experinace in UI tests also (because of time constraint not written them)

## Notes:

Focused more on functional stuff, there is the possibility to improve UI a lot due to time constraints stick with basic UI.
